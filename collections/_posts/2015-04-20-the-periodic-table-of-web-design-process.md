In my thinking around learning technology implementation (see [article 1][1] and [article 2][2], I've been influenced heavily by a number of wider project management methodologies, such as <a href="https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/prince2" target="_blank">Prince 2</a>, <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/agile-project-management-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html" target="_blank">Agile Software Development</a> and <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum" target="_blank">Scrum</a>.

It&#8217;s very easy just to focus on the &#8220;doing&#8221; of the implementation, but the preparation and follow-up are just as important.

You can see this in the &#8220;periodic table&#8221; shown below. Although it&#8217;s based on web-design, actually most, if not all, of these elements would apply in a learning technology implementation.

There are some things missing that you would probably want to include in a software implementation, for example:

  * software architecture
  * integrations
  * project roles

Even so, it&#8217;s a really useful guide to the things that need to be thought about.
