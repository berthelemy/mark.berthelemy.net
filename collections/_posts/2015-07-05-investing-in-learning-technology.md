#### Why invest in learning technology?

Organisations invest in Learning Technologies because they can, when used well:

+ Reduce the total costs of learning to the business &ndash; particularly by reducing travel and print costs, and increasing administrative efficiency
+ Increase flexibility &ndash; in terms of when and where learning materials and expertise can be accessed
+ Provide useful data upon which decisions can be made
+ Help to engage and motivate

However, when used inappropriately or poorly, learning technologies can have the opposite effect:

+ Increasing costs through expensive equipment that is under-used
+ Reducing flexibility by relying on proprietary technologies
+ Collecting large quantities of meaningless data
+ Demotivating employees who are used, in their lives outside work, to on-demand support at the point of need

#### Where should I spend my money?

Organisations that are using learning technology *well* will tend to invest in more than just the technology itself. They will spend money on:

+ *Infrastructure* &ndash; primarily wireless network connectivity
+ *Platforms* &ndash; the software through which employees will access learning materials, administrative processes and people
+ *Content* &ndash; a mix of lots of rapidly-developed, focussed content (not necessarily &ldquo;elearning&rdquo;) with a short lifespan and low production values, along with small numbers of bespoke content items with a long lifespan and high production values
+ *Equipment* &ndash; a mix of lots of low cost devices to produce, consume and communicate in the field, along with small numbers of higher cost devices for specialist, location-centred use
+ *People* &ndash; training and support for those who will be producing, leading and administrating, plus investment in online and face-to-face coaching, mentoring and curating

It&rsquo;s important to get the balance right, as failure to invest in one of these elements appropriately will often lead to a failed initiative.
