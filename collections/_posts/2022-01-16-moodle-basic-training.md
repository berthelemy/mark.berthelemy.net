You've got your Moodle site setup and configured to meet your organisation's needs. So now it's time to introduce your team to it.

I've listed below some of the key skills that I would expect to cover in any basic training.

### Leave the advanced training until later

These are basic skills. There's a whole lot more to Moodle that people will need to learn. But you probably don't need to cover all of that at the beginning. Hopefully a lot of that more advanced stuff will have been set up by your Moodle Solution Architect.

### This isn't everything you need

When launching a new Moodle site, there's a lot to discuss and agree. Not least things like naming conventions, use of images, roles and responsibilities and text style. Often this comes up during training sessions. Ideally they'll have been dealt with and agreed beforehand.

### Roles

I've split the table into three distinct roles (which may all be the same person - but I hope not):

1. **Course designer/teacher** - the person who creates the activities for the users of your Moodle site, and then tracks how those users are interacting with the activities. Note that this curriculum assumes people with this role are already able to design good teaching activities online.
2. **User administrator/support** - this is a separate Moodle role that I usually define in the system. They're able to setup users and provide support for common queries (eg. lost passwords, missing enrolments)
3. **System administrator** - the person (ideally 2 people) who can make system-wide changes. The sort of role that could break the site if they're not careful.
